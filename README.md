# Introductory Books Produced by the ISTO Printer Working Group

This repository will hold introductory books that are produced by the ISTO Printer Working Group (PWG). Unlike the formal specifications and other technical documents normally produced by the PWG, these books will serve as informal introductions and "how to's" that familiarize managers and developers with PWG-developed standards and technologies using real-world examples.
