What is IPP?
------------

IPP is an application level protocol used for distributed printing that
leverages Internet technologies.  The protocol allows a Client to inquire about
capabilities of and defaults for a Printer (supported media sizes, two-sided
printing, etc.), inquire about the state of the Printer (paper out/jam, low
ink/toner, etc.), submit files for printing, and inquire about and/or cancel
submitted print Jobs.  IPP is supported by all modern network printers and
replaces all legacy network protocols including port 9100 printing
and LPD/lpr.

IPP is widely implemented, including the following open source projects:

- [CUPS](https://www.cups.org/)
- [Java IPP Client Implementation](https://code.google.com/archive/p/jspi/)
- [Javascript IPP Client Implementation](https://github.com/williamkapke/ipp)
- [Python IPP Client Implementation](http://www.pykota.com/software/pkipplib/)
- [PWG IPP Sample Code](https://istopwg.github.io/ippsample)


IPP Overview
------------

The architecture for IPP defines an abstract data Model to provide information
about the printing process and the capabilities of the Printer.  This abstract
Model is hierarchical in nature and reflects the structure of the Printer and
the Jobs and Documents processed by the Printer.  Because the semantics of IPP
are attached to the (abstract) Model, the Client does not need to know the
implementation-specific details of the Printer.

IPP defines an encoding of the data in the Model for transfer between the
Client and Printer.  Clients send a request and then read a response using a
simple binary encoding.  Each request and response message has a version
number, an operation (request) or status (response) code, a request number, and
a list of attributes.  Each attribute has a type (keyword, URI, integer, etc.),
name, and zero or more values.  IPP messages can be followed by data such as
the file to print.

IPP uses HTTP as its transport protocol.  Each IPP request is a HTTP POST with
the IPP message data (and print file, if any) in the request message body.
The corresponding IPP response is returned in the POST response message body.
HTTP connections can be unencrypted, upgraded to TLS using an HTTP OPTIONS
request, or encrypted immediately (HTTPS).  HTTP POST requests can be
authenticated using any of the standard HTTP mechanisms.

> Note: Legacy network protocols do not support authentication, authorization,
> or privacy (encryption).


Key Concepts
------------

- URIs, operations, attributes, attribute groups.


URIs
----

- URIs are a general form of URLs used in web browsers.

- Talk about IPP (ipp:) and IPPS (ipps:) URIs being the equivalent of HTTP
  (http:) and HTTPS (https:) URLs, but on port 631 by default.

- Prefer using IPPS

- Talk about resource path (/ipp/print is now common, but not in the past)


Operations
----------

- List some common operations

- Show how client does a POST with application/ipp messages, gets a response in
  the same format.

- Operation code in request, status code in response, request ID and version in
  both.


### Requests

- Common values in request (operation code, version, request ID, printer URI,
  job ID for job requests)


### Responses

- Common values in response (status code, version, request ID)


Attributes
----------

- Name, type ("syntax"), and zero or more values.
- List of (common) syntaxes
- Examples


### Attribute Groups

- Used to group zero or more related attributes.

- Groups for operation (request/response), Printer, Job, etc.

- Special "end of attributes" group at the end of the IPP message.
