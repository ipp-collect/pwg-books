Introduction
============


What is IPP?
------------

The Internet Printing Protocol ("IPP") is a secure application level protocol
used for network printing.  The protocol allows a Client to inquire about
capabilities of and defaults for a Printer (supported media sizes, two-sided
printing, etc.), inquire about the state of the Printer (paper out/jam, low
ink/toner, etc.), submit files for printing, and inquire about and/or cancel
submitted print Jobs.  IPP is supported by all modern network printers and
replaces all legacy network protocols including port 9100 printing
and LPD/lpr.

IPP is widely implemented in software as well, including the following open
source projects:

- [CUPS](https://www.cups.org/)
- [Java IPP Client Implementation](https://code.google.com/archive/p/jspi/)
- [Javascript IPP Client Implementation](https://github.com/williamkapke/ipp)
- [Python IPP Client Implementation](http://www.pykota.com/software/pkipplib/)
- [PWG IPP Sample Code](https://istopwg.github.io/ippsample)


IPP Overview
------------

The IPP architecture defines an abstract, hierarchical data model that provides
information about the printing process and the print jobs and capabilities of
the printer.  Because the semantics of IPP are attached to this model, the
client (software) does not need to know the internal details of the printer
(hardware).

IPP uses HTTP as its transport protocol.  Each IPP request is a HTTP POST with
an IPP message (and print file, if any) in the request message body.  The
corresponding IPP response is returned in the POST response message body.  The
IPP message itself uses a simple binary encoding that is described in the
[next section](#ipp-message-encoding).  HTTP connections can be unencrypted,
upgraded to TLS encryption using an HTTP OPTIONS request, or encrypted
immediately (HTTPS).  HTTP POST requests can also be authenticated using any of
the usual HTTP mechanisms like Basic (username and password).

> Note: Legacy network protocols do not support authentication, authorization,
> or privacy (encryption).

Printers are identified using Universal Resource Identifiers ("URIs") with the
"ipp" or "ipps" scheme, for example:

    ipp://printer.example.com/ipp/print
    ipps://printer2.example.com:443/ipp/print
    ipps://server.example.com/ipp/print/printer3

These are mapped to "http" and "https" URLs, with a default port number of 631
for IPP.  For example, the previous IPP URIs would be mapped to:

    http://printer.example.com:631/ipp/print
    https://printer2.example.com/ipp/print
    https://server.example.com:631/ipp/print/printer3

> The resource path "/ipp/print" is commonly used by IPP printers, however there
> is no hard requirement to follow that convention and older IPP printers used
> a variety of different locations.  Consult your printer documentation or the
> printer's Bonjour registration information to determine the proper hostname,
> port number, and path to use for your printer.

Print jobs are identified using the printer's URI and a job number that is
unique to that printer.


IPP Message Encoding
--------------------

IPP messages use a common format for both requests (from the client to the
printer) and responses (from the printer to the client).  Each IPP message
starts with a version number (2.0 is the most common), an operation (request) or
status (response) code, a request number, and a list of attributes.  Attributes
are named and have strongly typed values like integers, keywords, names, and
URIs.  Attributes are also placed in groups according to their usage -
the operation group for attributes used for the operation request or response,
the job group for print job attributes, and so forth.

```
; IPP/2.0 request header for Print-Job request
02 00                  ; IPP version 2.0
00 02                  ; Print-Job operation code
00 00 00 2A            ; Request number 42

; Start of the operation attributes
01                     ; "operation-attributes-tag"
```

The first two attributes in an IPP message are always "attributes-charset",
which defines the character set to use for all name and text strings, and
"attributes-natural-language", which defines the default language ("en" for
English, "fr" for French, "ja" for Japanese, etc.) for those strings.

```
; "attributes-charset" = 'utf-8'
47                     ; "charset" tag
00 12                  ; name length 18 bytes
"attributes-charset"   ; attribute name
00 05                  ; value length 5 bytes
'utf-8'                ; value string

; "attributes-natural-language" = 'en'
48                     ; "naturalLanguage" tag
00 1B                  ; name length 27 bytes
"attributes-natural-language"
                       ; attribute name
00 02                  ; value length 2 bytes
'en'                   ; value string
```

The next attributes in a request are usually the printer's URI ("printer-uri")
and, if the request is targeting a print job, the job's ID number ("job-id").

```
; "printer-uri" = 'ipp://printer.example.com/ipp/print'
45                     ; "uri" tag
00 0B                  ; name length 11 bytes
"printer-uri"          ; attribute name
00 23                  ; value length 35 bytes
'ipp://printer.example.com/ipp/print'
                       ; value string
```

Most requests include the name of the user that is submitting the request
("requesting-user-name").

```
; "requesting-user-name" = 'John Doe'
42                     ; "nameWithoutLanguage" tag
00 14                  ; name length 20 bytes
"requesting-user-name" ; attribute name
00 08                  ; value length 8 bytes
'John Doe'             ; value string
```

A request containing an attached print file includes the MIME media type for
the file - 'text/plain' for text files, 'application/pdf' for PDF files, etc.

```
; "document-format" = 'text/plain'
49                     ; "mimeMediaType" tag
00 0F                  ; name length 15 bytes
"document-format"      ; attribute name
00 0A                  ; value length 10 bytes
"text/plain"           ; value string
```

At the end of the IPP request is the "end-of-attributes" tag, which is followed
by any print data.

```
03                     ; "end-of-attributes-tag"

; Start of print data
"Hello, world!"
0D 0A
"Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country."
0D 0A
...
```

The response message uses the same version number, request number, character
set, and natural language values as the request.  A status code replaces the
operation code in the initial message header.

```
; IPP/2.0 response header for Print-Job request
02 00                  ; IPP version 2.0
00 00                  ; successful-ok status code
00 00 00 2A            ; Request number 42

; Start of the operation attributes
01                     ; "operation-attributes-tag"

; "attributes-charset" = 'utf-8'
47                     ; "charset" tag
00 12                  ; name length 18 bytes
"attributes-charset"   ; attribute name
00 05                  ; value length 5 bytes
'utf-8'                ; value string

; "attributes-natural-language" = 'en'
48                     ; "naturalLanguage" tag
00 1B                  ; name length 27 bytes
"attributes-natural-language"
                   ; attribute name
00 02                  ; value length 2 bytes
'en'                   ; value string
```

These are followed by operation-specific attributes.  For example, the Print-Job
operation returns the print job identification and state attributes.

```
; Start of the job attributes
02                     ; "job-attributes-tag"

; "job-printer-uri" = 'ipp://printer.example.com/ipp/print'
45                     ; "uri" tag
00 0F                  ; name length 15 bytes
"job-printer-uri"      ; attribute name
00 23                  ; value length 35 bytes
'ipp://printer.example.com/ipp/print'
                       ; value string

; "job-id" = 123
21                     ; "integer" tag
00 06                  ; name length 6 bytes
"job-id"               ; attribute name
00 04                  ; value length 4 bytes
00 00 00 7B            ; value integer

; "job-state" = 5 (processing)
23                     ; "enum" tag
00 09                  ; name length 9 bytes
"job-state"            ; attribute name
00 04                  ; value length 4 bytes
00 00 00 05            ; value integer

; "job-state-reasons" = 'job-printing','waiting-for-user-action'
44                     ; "keyword" tag
00 10                  ; name length 16 bytes
"job-state-reasons"    ; attribute name
00 0C                  ; value length 12 bytes
"job-printing"         ; value string
44                     ; "keyword" tag
00 00                  ; name length 0 bytes (another value)
00 17                  ; value length 23 bytes
"waiting-for-user-action"
                       ; value string

03                     ; "end-of-attributes-tag"
```
