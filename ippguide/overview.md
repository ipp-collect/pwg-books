Chapter 1: Overview of IPP
==========================

IPP defines an abstract model for printing, including operations with common
semantics (business logic) for working with the model's objects.  Because the
same semantics of IPP are followed by all Printers, the Client (software) does
not need to know the internal details of the Printer (hardware).

IPP uses HTTP as its transport protocol.  Each IPP request is a HTTP POST with
a binary IPP message and print file, if any, in the request message body.  The
corresponding IPP response is returned in the POST response.  HTTP connections
can be unencrypted, upgraded to TLS encryption using an HTTP OPTIONS request, or
encrypted immediately (HTTPS).  HTTP POST requests can also be authenticated
using any of the usual HTTP mechanisms.

> Note: Legacy network protocols do not support authentication, authorization,
> or privacy (encryption).

Printers are identified using Universal Resource Identifiers ("URIs") with the
"ipp" or "ipps" scheme.  Print Jobs are identified using the Printer's URI and a
Job number that is unique to that Printer.  The following are example Printer
URIs:

```
ipp://printer.example.com/ipp/print
ipps://printer2.example.com:443/ipp/print
ipps://server.example.com/ipp/print/printer3
```

These are mapped to "http" and "https" URLs, with a default port number of 631
for IPP.  For example, the previous IPP URIs would be mapped to:

```
http://printer.example.com:631/ipp/print
https://printer2.example.com/ipp/print
https://server.example.com:631/ipp/print/printer3
```

> Note: The resource path "/ipp/print" is commonly used by IPP Printers, however
> there is no hard requirement to follow that convention and older IPP Printers
> used a variety of different locations.  Consult your Printer documentation or
> the Printer's Bonjour (DNS-SD) registration information to determine the
> proper hostname, port number, and path to use for your Printer.


IPP Operations
--------------

The following IPP operations are commonly used:

- Create-Job: Create a new (empty) print job.

- Send-Document: Add a document to a print job.

- Print-Job: Create a new print job with a single document.

- Get-Printer-Attributes: Get Printer status and capabilities.

- Get-Jobs: Get a list of queued jobs.

- Get-Job-Attributes: Get job status and options.

- Cancel-Job: Cancel a queued job.

The [IANA IPP Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/ipp-registrations)
lists all of the registered IPP operations.

> Note: IPP provides two ways to print a single file - using the Print-Job
> operation or using a combination of the Create-Job and Send-Document
> operations.  The [IPP Implementor's Guide v2.0](#standards) describes which
> operations to use.


IPP Message Encoding
--------------------

IPP messages use a common format for both requests (from the Client to the
printer) and responses (from the Printer to the Client).  Each IPP message
starts with a version number (2.0 is the most common), an operation (request) or
status (response) code, a request number, and a list of attributes.  Attributes
are named and have strongly typed values such as:

- "collection": A list of key/value pairs that have been grouped together.
- "enum": Integer enumerated values, typically starting at 3, where each value
  has a specific meaning.
- "integer": 32-bit signed integers from -2147483648 to 2147483647.
- "keyword": A lowercase string identifier like "one-sided" or
   "iso\_a4\_210x297mm".
- "mimeMediaType": A MIME media type like "text/plain" or "application/pdf".
- "name": A human-readable name like "Bob Smith".
- "text": A human-readable string like "Printer is out of paper."
- "uri": A Universal Resource Identifier like "https://www.example.com" or
  "ipps://printer.example.com/ipp/print".

Attributes are also placed in groups according to their usage - the 'operation'
group for attributes used for the operation request or response, the 'job' group
for print job attributes, and so forth.

The first two attributes in an IPP message are always:

1. "attributes-charset" which defines the character set to use for all name
   and text strings, and
2. "attributes-natural-language" which defines the default language for those
   strings, e.g., "en" for English, "fr" for French, "ja" for Japanese, etc.

The next attributes must be the Printer's URI ("printer-uri") and, if the
request is targeting a print job, the job's ID number ("job-id").

Most requests also include the "requesting-user-name" attribute that provides
the name of the user.

A request containing an attached print file includes the MIME media type for
the file ("document-format").  The media type is 'text/plain' for text files,
'image/jpeg' for JPEG files, 'application/pdf' for PDF files, etc.

The following example encodes a Print-Job request using the `ipptool` test file
format:

```
{
    VERSION 2.0
    OPERATION Print-Job
    REQUEST-ID 42

    GROUP operation-attributes-tag
    ATTR charset "attributes-charset" "utf-8"
    ATTR naturalLanguage "attributes-natural-language" "en"
    ATTR uri "printer-uri" "ipp://printer.example.com/ipp/print"
    ATTR name "requesting-user-name" "John Doe"
    ATTR mimeMediaType "document-format" "text/plain"

    FILE "testfile.txt"
}
```

The same request using the CUPS API would look like the following:

```
#include <cups/cups.h>

...

http_t *http;
ipp_t *request, *response;

http = httpConnect2("printer.example.com", 631, NULL, AF_UNSPEC, HTTP_ENCRYPTION_IF_REQUESTED, 1, 30000, NULL);

request = ippNewRequest(IPP_OP_PRINT_JOB);
ippAddString(request, IPP_TAG_OPERATION, IPP_TAG_URI, "printer-uri", NULL, "ipp://printer.example.com/ipp/print");
ippAddString(request, IPP_TAG_OPERATION, IPP_TAG_NAME, "requesting-user-name", NULL, "John Doe");
ippAddString(request, IPP_TAG_OPERATION, IPP_TAG_MIMETYPE, "document-format", NULL, "text/plain");

response = cupsDoFileRequest(http, request, "/ipp/print", "testfile.txt");

ipp_attribute_t *attr;
const char *name;
char value[2048];

for (attr = ippFirstAttribute(response); attr; attr = ippNextAttribute(response))
{
  name = ippGetName(attr);

  if (name)
  {
    ippAttributeString(attr, value, sizeof(value));
    printf("%s=%s\n", name, value);
  }
}
```

And this is how you'd send a Print-Job request using the nodejs API:

```
var ipp = require("ipp");
var Printer = ipp.Printer("http://printer.example.com:631/ipp/print");
var fs = require("fs");
var document;

fs.readFile("testfile.txt", function(err, data) {
  if (err) throw err;

  document = data;
});

var msg = {
  "operation-attributes-tag": {
    "requesting-user-name": "John Doe",
    "document-format": "text/plain"
  },
  data: document;
};

printer.execute("Print-Job", msg, function(err, res) {
        console.log(err);
        console.log(res);
});
```

The response message uses the same version number, request number, character
set, and natural language values as the request.  A status code replaces the
operation code in the initial message header - for the Print-Job operation the
Printer will return the 'successful-ok' status code if the print request is
successful or 'server-error-printer-busy' if the Printer is busy and wants you
to try again at a later time.

The character set and natural language values in the response are followed by
operation-specific attributes.  For example, the Print-Job operation returns the
print job identifier ("job-id") and state ("job-state" and "job-state-reasons")
attributes.
